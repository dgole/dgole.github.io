# Settlers of Catan Die Roll Tracker
------
We've all played Catan and we could just swear that we should be winning if only the dice were rolling fairly.  Well now you can back up your claim (or not) with numbers.  

[Link to google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GBkdbZjecqeQJINy2JpJr2OjcDg6ZwzOF6jQbamG5KM/edit?usp=sharing)

Instructions: Make a copy of this sheet so you can edit it.  Enter each roll somewhere in the red shaded area below (do not overwrite previous rolls).  The numbers in row 2 tell you how many times more or less each number has been rolled compared to what one would expect based on the probability of rolling each number.  Red means that number is under-rolled, green means it's over-rolled.
